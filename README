A JFlex/Cup implementation for the C-Minus language.

To build and compile the project, run:
  $ make

Makefile builds the scanner file c-.flex using the JFlex lexer/scanner 
generator for Java, builds the parser file c-.cup using the CUP LALR(1) parser 
generator for Java along with the abstract syntax tree Java files found in the 
directory /absyn and the symbol table Java files found in the directory /symb, 
and finally compiles the C-Minus Main Java file.

To scan/parse C-Minus source code with optional arguments, run: 
  $ java -classpath ./java/cup.jar:. C- [-a] [-s] [file_name.cm]

To run the test suite of sample C-Minus programs, run:
  $ make test

To run the test suite of sample C-Minus programs with the abstract syntax tree, 
symbal tables, or both, run:
  (1) $ make test_tree
  (2) $ make test_table
  (3) $ make test_all
